# Computer setup notes

This is **not** a tutorial. I'm not going to explain much. Instead,
this is just notes about how I've setup my computer, and generally the
changes I've made to my setup. I think a lot of the stuff is good
here, and so may be interesting to you, but of course I do not certify
that everything here is safe or ideal. This is the 2nd edition of
setup notes, the old one is at [old-setup-log.md](./old-setup-log.md).

# 2018-12-23: Initial fresh install

I ran the live cd for Ubuntu 18.04.1, and ran ubuntu rather than doing
the install directly.

## Software raid for filesystem

In theory, my laptop has hardware raid.  However, I recall from a year
or so ago struggling to even get Linux live CDs to boot while the
UEFI + harware raid was on. Disabling both resolved the issue.

So, for this fresh install I wanted to use software raid at boot time.
I mostly followed this old forum thread:
https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1551087

I created the following partitions on my 256gb nvme ssds:

```
/nvme0n1p1 /boot (ext4)
/nvme0n1p2 swap1 (unformatted)
/nvme0n1p3 root1 (unformatted)

/nvme0n1p1 /misc (ext4)
/nvme0n1p2 swap2 (unformatted)
/nvme0n1p3 root2 (unformatted)
```

Both `/boot` and `/misc` were set to `1gb` size.

Both `swap1` and `swap2` were set to `43008mb` (`42gb`).  I later
realized that the swap partitions were somewhat of a mistake.  I made
them so large because I wanted to hibernate my full `40gb` of ram.
However, I hadn't accounted for raid 0 combining the partition sizes,
so a full `84gb` of swap, whcih is way too much.  Also, these days I
think it makes more sense to have a swap file rather than a swap
partition.  So anyway, continuing this with what I actually did.  I've
later decided to repurpose the swap partition as an encrypted raid
partition.

```
sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --verbose --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/nvme0n1p2 /dev/nvme1n1p2
sudo mdadm --create /dev/md1 --verbose --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/nvme0n1p3 /dev/nvme1n1p3

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/md1
sudo mkswap /dev/md0
```

(Note: md0 and md1 are flipped w.r.t. the forum post - just a consequence of how I ordered the partitions)

## In ubuntu installer

* Minimal installation

* Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware and
  additional media formats

* Formatted /dev/md1 as ext4 mounted to /

* Formatted /dev/md0 as swap

* Formatted /dev/nvme0n1p1 as ext4 mounted to /boot

* Selected /dev/nvme0n for boot partition

## After installation

It took a couple tries to get this booting properly.  While still in
the live cd, I did the following, based on the post installation
instructions:

```
sudo su

# Mount the install target
mount /dev/md1 /target

# Bind mount stuff from live cd OS over stuff in the target, so that chroot works
for f in sys proc dev dev/pts; do mount --bind $f /target/$f; done

# Mount the boot partition
u=`blkid -o value -s UUID /dev/sda1`
mkdir /media/$u
mount -t ext4 /dev/sda1 /media/$u
mount --bind /media/$u /target/boot
```

In order to access the internet within the chroot, I copied over
`resolv.conf` as described in
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280500/unable-to-reach-network-from-chroot

```
cp /etc/resolv.conf /target/etc/resolv.conf
```

Finally, I could enter the chroot, essentially pretending to be
running inside the newly installed filesystem, and install mdadm to
it.  Why this isn't included in the install by default (or by option)
is beyond me.

```
chroot /target
apt update
apt install mdadm
```

## Reassembling raid in live cd

Since this took multiple tries, sometimes I needed to re-assemble the
raid 0 arrays while running the live cd. I also needed to create
`/target`.  From memory I think the commands were:

```
sudo mdadm --assemble --verbose /dev/md0 /dev/nvme0n1p2 /dev/nvme1n1p2
sudo mdadm --assemble --verbose /dev/md1 /dev/nvme0n1p3 /dev/nvme1n1p3
cd /
mkdir target
```

# 2018-12-25: Using slock for login password and login-after-suspend

I thought it'd be quite nice to be able to start up applications
concurrently with typing in my login password.  I'm not sure how to do
this with gdm, it may well be impossible, so instead I did the following:

* Enabled autologin by setting the following in
  `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf`:

```
AutomaticLoginEnable = true
AutomaticLogin = mgsloan
```

* Made xmonad spawn `slock` first thing on start. I know this is
  highly iffy as a security mechanism, but I think it's good enough
  for my purposes. I like the obscurity of the whole screen changing
  colors depending on the state of slock.

* I wanted to reliably run slock on suspend, so I followed the
  instructions
  [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Slock#Lock_on_suspend),
  particularly, putting the following in
  `/etc/systemd/system/slock@.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Lock X session using slock for user %i
Before=sleep.target

[Service]
User=%i
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/xset dpms force suspend
ExecStart=/usr/bin/slock

[Install]
WantedBy=sleep.target
```

(this file is also available at `~/env/systemd/slock@.service`)

This was then enabled via:

```sh
systemctl enable slock@mgsloan.service
```

# 2018-12-25: More xmonad setup

I'm no longer attempting to use the `GNOME + XMonad`, since it doesn't
seem to work for me.  See some [extensive discussion
here](https://github.com/Gekkio/gnome-session-xmonad/issues/10). So, I
removed it:

It turned out that all I needed was the session / desktop installed by
`sudo apt install --no-install-recommends xmonad`.

I also made sure that my xmonad gets used on startup by doing the
following:

```sh
cd /usr/bin
sudo rm xmonad
sudo ln -s ~/.xmonad/xmonad-x86_64-linux xmonad
```

It's seems like poor practice to link into a home dir from
`/usr/bin/`, but oh well.

By default, `xmonad` tries to recompile on start if its name isn't
`xmonad-x86_64-linux` (and this check doesn't seem to look through
symlinks). I've patched my version of xmonad to not do this, to make
boot faster.

# 2018-12-25: More fine tuning of boot

I wanted to immediately skip grub, but still have the option of
entering the menu by holding shift.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get
this to work despite trying the following 2 approaches:

- [Checking keystatus --shift, setting timeout if test passes](https://ask.fedoraproject.org/en/question/52450/how-to-get-to-rescue-mode-when-grub-timeout-is-0/?answer=52536#post-id-52536).

- [31_hold_shift
  script](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks#Hide_GRUB_unless_the_Shift_key_is_held_down).
  This script is complicated, and `sudo update-grub` failed with it.

So, instead I kept my tuning to `/etc/default/grub`.  In particular:

The following settings make the grub menu appear for 1 second before
automatically choosing the default boot:

```
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu
GRUB_TIMEOUT=1
```

I prefer text boot and shutdown, instead of showing a graphical
booting screen. This setting

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="text"
```

The next setting I'm not sure about.  I noticed that `30_os-prober`
can be disabled via the following environment variable.  It seems like
it might be more efficient to skip it, and I don't seem to need
it. So:

```
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER="true"
```

The configuration file is included in this repo, and can be installed
via:

```
sudo cp -f ~/env/grub/grub /etc/default/grub
sudo update-grub
```

# 2018-12-25: Removing snapd

Snaps seem to show up during boot and in `df` as loopback
devices. Yuck!

```
sudo apt purge snapd squashfs-tools gnome-software-plugin-snap
```

# 2018-12-25: Removing other unnecessary boot stuff

```
sudo systemctl disable postfix.service
sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon.service
```

# 2018-12-25: Userspace backlight control

```
sudo cp ~/env/udev-rules/90-backlight.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME
```

# 2018-12-30: Installing nvidia drivers

```
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-390
```

It will then default to using the discrete graphics, which means more
power consumption, but also grants the capability to use a 4K external
monitor. Running `sudo nvidia-settings`, and selecting `Prime
Profiles` can allow switching between the two (requires a restart).
This is particularly useful when traveling, because that's when I
value reduced power consumption and don't care about the other
outputs.

# 2018-12-30: More utilities

```
sudo apt install lm-sensors
```

# 2018-12-30: More boot service removal

This service held up shutdown once, so removing it. I don't need
remote printers.

```
sudo systemctl disable cups-browsed.service
```

# 2018-12-31: Installing gist

(used by xmonad configuration to make gists from clipboard)

https://github.com/defunkt/gist

```
sudo apt install ruby xsel
sudo gem install gist
gist --login
```

# 2018-12-31: Installing tokei

```
cd ~/oss
git clone Aaronepower/tokei
cd tokei

```

# 2019-01-06: Patched systemd-cat

I added logging of most processes spawned by my xmonad configuration!
All the logs get sent to systemd's journal via the `systemd-cat`
utility. However, I want to distinguish in the logs whether the
message is from stdout or stderr, and so I wrote a change adding this
feature and opened [a
PR](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/11336).

Initially, I wrote the patch atop `v237` of the systemd repo, and the
resulting `systemd-cat` worked directly.  To open the PR, I rebased it
atop `master`. The binary resulting from building this version did not
work when copied to `~/.local/bin`:

> systemd-cat: error while loading shared libraries: libsystemd-shared-240.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

This error can be resolved by using a symbolic link into the build
dir. Though admittedly it's probably rather sketchy to be mixing
systemd versions.

```sh
ln -s ~/oss/systemd/build/systemd-cat ~/.local/bin/systemd-cat
```

To build systemd, all I needed to do was:

```sh
sudo apt install meson
sudo apt build-dep systemd
meson build
ninja -C build
```

If `systemd-cat` doesn't work on startup, `xmonad` will not use it to
wrap process invocations.

# 2019-01-12: Fixing external outputs of graphics card

Oddly enough, `xrandr` and `nvidia-settings` started refusing to list
any external outputs.  After quite a while of poking around, I noticed
a difference in the healthy `journalctl` logs vs the broken
`journalctl` logs.  Specifically, in the healthy log, it seems that
systemd would halt the persistence daemon:

```
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: Received signal 15
 treetop systemd[1]: Stopping NVIDIA Persistence Daemon...
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: Socket closed.
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: PID file unlocked.
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: PID file closed.
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: The daemon no longer has permission to remove its runtime data directory /var/run/nvidia-persistenced
 treetop nvidia-persistenced[774]: Shutdown (774)
```

Whereas in the broken log, `nvidia-persistenced` is running during
driver initialization. I found a [relevant github
thread](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/720#issuecomment-389721511),
and, happily, updating the contents of the systemd configuration for
`nvidia-persistenced` resolves the issue!

Contents of `/lib/systemd/system/nvidia-persistenced.service`:


```
[Unit]
Description=NVIDIA Persistence Daemon
Wants=syslog.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nvidia-persistenced --user nvidia-persistenced --no-persistence-mode --verbose
ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -rf /var/run/nvidia-persistenced
```

User overrides of these files should go in `/etc/systemd`, so I
created a new file `/etc/systemd/system/nvidia-persistenced.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=NVIDIA Persistence Daemon
Wants=syslog.target

[Service]
Type=forking
;PIDFile=/var/run/nvidia-persistenced/nvidia-persistenced.pid
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nvidia-persistenced --verbose
ExecStopPost=/bin/rm -rf /var/run/nvidia-persistenced

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

(this file is also available at `~/env/systemd/nvidia-persistenced.service`)

# 2019-01-12: notify daemon `dunst`

Today I added use of the notify daemon `dunst`.  I wanted to use some
features newer than the version in the ubuntu package repository, and
so I included it as a submodule and built it from source by doing:

```sh
cd ~/oss/dunst
make
```

There is a symlink included with the repo, from `~/.local/bin/dunst`
to `~/oss/dunst/dunst`.

# 2018-01-15: nvtop

I installed `nvtop` from https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop , and it's now
part of my initial startup applications.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop.git
mkdir -p nvtop/build && cd nvtop/build
cmake .. -DNVML_RETRIEVE_HEADER_ONLINE=True
make
sudo make install
```

# 2018-01-15: powertop --autotune

Typically `powertop --autotune` seems to do no harm, though I am a bit
concerned I might run into funny behavior in the future and not
realize it's actually due to some powertop tuning.  Anyway, I'm trying
out applying autotuning at startup via a systemd service [as described
here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/powertop#Apply_settings). I've
included `~/env/systemd/powertop.service` in this repo.

# 2018-01-15: dependencies for byzanz-record-region.sh

I finally got around to installing the dependencies needed to record
gifs of a portion of the screen.  First, building and installing
xrectsel from source:

```
cd ~/oss
git clone https://github.com/lolilolicon/xrectsel
cd xrectsel
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix ~/.local
make
make install
```

Byzanz appears to be available from apt:

```
sudo apt install byzanz
```

# 2018-01-15: scrot

```
sudo apt install scrot
```

# 2018-01-16: journalctl -g

The stock version of `journalctl` on ubuntu does not support grepping
messages. So, I've done `sudo apt install libpcre2-dev`, rebuilt
systemd`, and created a symbolic link from `~/.local/bin/journalctl`
to `~/oss/systemd/build/journalctl`.  Seems to work great now!

# 2018-01-16: ccze

```
sudo apt install ccze
```

This is used to colorize journalctl logs

# 2018-01-21: "man -H" for browser man pages

Dependency needed for it to work:

```
sudo apt install groff

# 2018-01-22: Installing zoom

```

# 2018-01-26: Fixing bluetooth

A few days ago, bluetooth stopped working. The prompt for bluetoothctl
didn't display any devices, and was not associated with a controller.

```
mgsloan@treetop:~$ bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[bluetooth]# power on
No default controller available
```

After a bit of googling, I found
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1719775#p1719775 did the
trick.  Specifically:

```
rfkill block bluetooh
rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

I am not certain if the rfkill stuff was necessary.  Next time this
happens, if it does, I will try just the `sudo systemctl restart
bluetooth`, and possibly automate this.

# 2020-07-28: Fixing nvlock: client timed out

Via a [very helpful post](https://johnmee.com/linux-nvidia-8700):

Blacklisted nouveau, probably not necessary but may as well

```
% sudo bash

# 2020-08-13: Auto xrandr

Following https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/171916

In `/etc/udev/rules.d/95-monitor-hotplug.rules`:

```

# 2020-08-23: Removal of auto xrandr

The monitor `95-monitor-hotplug.rules` appears to have created instability, so removed it.
