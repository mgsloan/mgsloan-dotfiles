# My laptop's brightness control doesn't automatically work
# by itself, and xbacklight is looking in the wrong directory
# to change my backlight settings, so I quickly wrote up these
# scripts to bindsym them to my brightness control keys. Simple
# and clean.

# Make sure that whatever you're using to call them has sufficient
# perimissions.

# Takes an input of a number, to add to the current brightness.
